        <div>style sheet language 
            used for specifying the presentation and styling of a document
             written in a markup language such as HTML or XML 
             (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML).[1] CSS 
             is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, 
             alongside HTML and JavaScript.[2]
            CSS is designed to enable the separation of content and 
            presentation, including layout, colors, and fonts.[3] 
            This separation can improve content accessibility</div>
